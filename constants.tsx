export const Q010_CEACR_COMMENT = `The BAK indicates that workers with earnings less than €425.70 per month are covered only in case of incapacity for work due to an industrial accident, but not in case of suspension of earnings due to ill health, as required by the Convention. The BAK further indicates that the number of domestic workers in “marginal employment” who are excluded from sickness insurance coverage is higher than those who are fully insured. The Committee recalls that, notwithstanding Article 2(1) of the Convention which requires that manual and non-manual workers, including apprentices, employed by industrial undertakings and commercial undertakings, outworkers and domestic servants be compulsorily covered by sickness insurance, Article 2(2)(a) allows some exceptions to be made in respect of employment of a certain nature, including occasional, casual and subsidiary employment. **_In view of the above, the Committee requests the Government to indicate how many workers are excluded from sickness insurance due to the earnings threshold, and to provide information on any other means of protection to ensure that these workers, in case of sickness, have access to medical care and, where sickness involves a suspension of earnings, to income support._**`;

export const CAS_FOLLOW_UP_CEACR_COMMENT = `In its previous comments, the Committee noted that the Law on prohibiting the recruitment of child soldiers criminalizes the recruitment of children under the age of 18 years into the Afghan Security Forces. The Committee also noted that a total of 116 cases of recruitment and use of children, including one girl, were documented in 2015. Out of these: 13 cases were attributed to the Afghan National Defence and Security forces; five to the Afghan National Police; five to the Afghan Local Police; and three to the Afghan National Army; while the majority of verified cases were attributed to the Taliban and other armed groups who used children for combat and suicide attacks. The United Nations verified 1,306 incidents resulting in 2,829 child casualties (733 killed and 2,096 injured), an average of 53 children were killed or injured every week. A total of 92 children were abducted in 2015 in 23 incidents.

In this regard, the Committee noted the following measures taken by the Government:
The Government of Afghanistan signed an Action Plan with the United Nations on 30 January 2011 to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children by the Afghan National Security Forces, including the Afghan National Police, Afghan Local Police and Afghan National Army.
A roadmap to accelerate the implementation of the Action Plan was endorsed by the Government on 1 August 2014.
The Government endorsed age-assessment guidelines to prevent the recruitment of minors.
In 2015 and early 2016, three additional child protection units were established in Mazar e Sharif, Jalalabad and Kabul, bringing the total to seven. These units are embedded in Afghan National Police recruitment centres and are credited with preventing the recruitment of hundreds of children.

The Committee notes that the Conference Committee recommended that the Government take measures as a matter of urgency to ensure the full and immediate demobilization of all children and to put a stop, in practice, to the forced recruitment of children into armed forces and groups. It further recommended the Government to take immediate and effective measures to ensure that thorough investigations and prosecutions of all persons who forcibly recruit children for use in armed conflict are carried out, and that sufficiently effective and dissuasive penalties are imposed in law and practice. Finally, the Conference Committee recommended the Government to take effective and time-bound measures to provide for the rehabilitation and social integration of children who are forced to join armed groups.

The Committee notes the IOE’s indication that children are engaged in armed conflict in Afghanistan. The Committee notes the Government representative’s indication to the Conference Committee that the Law on the Prohibition of Children’s Recruitment in the Armed Forces (2014), along with other associated instruments, has helped prevent the recruitment of 496 children into national and local police ranks in 2017. Moreover, the Ministry of Interior, in cooperation with relevant government agencies, was effectively implementing Presidential Decree No. 129 which prohibits, among others, the use or recruitment of children in police ranks. Inter-ministerial commissions tasked with the prevention of child recruitment in national and local police have been established in Kabul and the provinces, and child support centres have been set up in 20 provinces, with efforts under way to establish similar centres in the remaining provinces. Finally, the Committee notes the Government’s indication that the National Directorate of Security has recently issued Order No. 0555, prohibiting the recruitment of underage persons and that the Order is being implemented in all security institutions and monitored by national and international human rights organizations. **_While acknowledging the complexity of the situation on the ground and the presence of armed groups and armed conflict in the country, the Committee requests the Government to continue its efforts in taking immediate and effective measures to put a stop, in practice, to the recruitment of children under 18 years by armed groups, the national armed forces and police authorities, as well as measures to ensure the demobilization of children involved in armed conflict._** **_It once again urges the Government to take immediate and effective measures to ensure that thorough investigations and robust prosecutions of persons who forcibly recruit children under 18 years of age for use in armed conflict are carried out, and that sufficiently effective and dissuasive penalties are imposed in practice._** **_Finally, it requests the Government to take effective and time-bound measures to remove children from armed groups and armed forces and ensure their rehabilitation and social integration, and to provide information on the measures taken in this regard and on the results achieved._**`;
